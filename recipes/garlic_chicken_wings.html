        <li>2 pounds chicken wings</li>
        <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons green onions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix baking powder, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pat chicken wings dry with paper towels, then toss them in spice mixture until evenly coated. Arrange wings in a single layer in the air fryer basket.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook wings in the preheated air fryer until crispy and golden brown, juices are clear, and meat is no longer pink at the bone, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, make the honey garlic sauce. Stir honey, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger together in a small saucepan over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a separate small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and water until smooth, then add to the saucepan. Cook until sauce thickens, 1 to 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer wings to a large bowl, pour honey garlic sauce over wings, and toss to coat evenly. Garnish with chopped green onions and serve hot.
