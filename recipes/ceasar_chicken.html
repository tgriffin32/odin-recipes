        <p>
            "If you think you can't cook, this baked Caesar chicken recipe
            will convice people otherwise," according to recipe developer
            Julian Hale. With a creamy sauce and buttery crouton topping, 
            This recipe is perfect for simple weeknights at home.

        <p>
            It's as easy whisking the topping together, pounding chicken 
            to an even thickness, mixing ingredients for a savory dressing, 
            topping it with the crouton mixture and throwing it in the oven. 
            You'll never use your old recipe again.
