            "If you think you can't cook, this baked Caesar chicken recipe
            will convice people otherwise," according to recipe developer
            Julian Hale. With a creamy sauce and buttery crouton topping, 
            This recipe is perfect for simple weeknights at home.

            It's as easy whisking the topping together, pounding chicken 
            to an even thickness, mixing ingredients for a savory dressing, 
            topping it with the crouton mixture and throwing it in the oven. 
            You'll never use your old recipe again.
