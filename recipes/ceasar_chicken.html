        <p>
            "If you think you can't cook, this baked Caesar chicken recipe
            will convice people otherwise," according to recipe developer
            Julian Hale. With a creamy sauce and buttery crouton topping, 
            This recipe is perfect for simple weeknights at home.

        <p>
            It's as easy whisking the topping together, pounding chicken 
            to an even thickness, mixing ingredients for a savory dressing, 
            topping it with the crouton mixture and throwing it in the oven. 
            You'll never use your old recipe again.

                    Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 375 
                    degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat a 2-quart baking
                     dish with nonstick spray.

                    butter; toss to mix. Set aside.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of 
                    plastic wrap. Pound to an even thickness with 
                    a meat mallet.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Sprinkle with pepper and salt on both sides and 
                    place chicken into the prepared baking dish.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> 
                <p>    
                    Stir together salad dressing, sour cream, and flour in a small bowl.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Spoon salad dressing mixture over chicken and turn to coat.               
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Top with crouton mixture.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until topping is browned and chicken is longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with parsley.
